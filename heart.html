                West Tennessee Heart and Vascular Center (WTHVC)
                at Jackson-Madison County General Hospital has achieved
                the Chest Pain Center Accreditation with Primary PCI
                by the American College of Cardiology Accreditation
                Services. PCI, also known as angioplasty, is a procedure
                that helps to open narrowed arteries in the heart either
                with balloon angioplasty or stents. WTHVC has earned
                exceptionally high quality ratings for treatment of heart
                attacks including two quality achievement awards from
                AHA Mission: Lifeline for STEMI and NSTEMI, as well
                as Platinum Performance from NCDR ACTION Registry
                for numerous consecutive years. The 30-day re-admission
                rate is much lower for both heart attacks and heart
                failure than the national average, as well as our
                infection rates.

                "We always thought we had to go to Memphis or
                Nashville back then, but not many people there receive
                the level of cardiac care we have here in West Tennessee today."

                "The staff at WTHVC Cardiac Rehab care about people and
                go out of their way to provide quality care. Their coaching
                and nurturing have made me feel 15 years younger."
