# west-tn-healthcare
We created our website for West Tennessee Healthcare. It is a non-profit Hospital chain in West Tennessee. Blue is a calming non-threatening color and makes people feel relaxed which is needed for a hospital
We were told to put the title, logo, and motto on the top
we used the F technique to make what you want to see on the top and stretching along the side
