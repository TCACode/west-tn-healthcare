    <p class="cancer">
            At the Kirkland Cancer Center, we are redefining the healing process. Whether you<br> 
            are looking for a second opinion or physicians to be with you through your cancer<br>
            journey, we are here to serve you. The Kirkland Cancer Center works cohesively with<br>
            the Jackson-Madison County General Hospital Surgery and Radiology Departments where<br>
            surgical procedures, stereotactic biopsies, bone scans, CT scans, MRIs, and mammographies<br>
            are routinely performed. Clinical research trials are available to eligible patients<br>
            as well. The Medical Oncology and Radiation Oncology Departments strive to meet each<br>
            patient's physical, emotional, and spiritual needs during their radiation therapy,<br> 
            chemotherapy, medical oncology, and other treatments. To assure comprehensive treatment,<br>
            these professionals work closely with nutritional, psychological, social service, and<br>
            pastoral care staff as well as physicians. A multidisciplinary group of physicians<br> 
            attends weekly Tumor Board meetings to discuss patient treatments. Tumor Registry,<br> 
            another educational resource, assists cancer doctors with their analyses of cancer<br>
            therapies and subsequent outcomes. Meeting the special needs of those patients and<br>
            their families facing life-limiting illness, Hospice of West Tennessee assures quality<br>
            of life and provides emotional support through palliative care. Community Education<br>
            remains a Cancer Center priority with sponsorship of free cancer screenings and programs<br>
            reaching thousands yearly.
